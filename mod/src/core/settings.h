//
//   [GlintSpotter]
//   Key=91        ; virtual-key code in hex for the trigger. 91 is Scroll Lock.
//   Spy=1         ; log every map icon the game creates, through slot 170
//   Mark=clue,artifact,...   ; node names worth a pin, matched anywhere in
//                            ; the prefab path
//   Survey=0      ; one press per place pins every candidate the old actor
//                 ; search found, labelled by distance. A diagnostic from
//                 ; before the level gimmick table; off by default now.
//   Guess=0       ; pin the node nearest the crosshair when the game has not
//                 ; marked anything. Off: only what the game marks is pinned.
//   Radius=0      ; optional cap in metres on how far a node can be. Zero,
//                 ; the default, means everything the game has loaded, which
//                 ; is already a few hundred metres and no more.

// Master Looter's notes record a whole test round lost to a key appended at the
// end of a sectioned ini, where it landed under the wrong section and read as
// nothing. This reader has one section, so a key anywhere in the file is read,
// and an unknown key is logged rather than dropped.
